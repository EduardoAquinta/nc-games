            <h2>Welcome to Northcoders Boardgame reviews!</h2>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by. We at northcoders take our leisure time very seriously. When we want to unwind after a heavy week of mentoring and programming and losing hair over CSS styling, our go-to place to be is the boardgaming table.</p>

            <p>With a large selection of games to hand, we decided it would be a great idea to help others curate their collection with this heady mix of party, euro, and dexterity games.</p>
